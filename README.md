# Guitar Tuner Apple Watch app

## Description
This is a Guitar Tuner app designed to allow guitarists to tune a guitar using an Apple Watch. Currently, this project consists only of the design in SwiftUI code. The actual functionality of the app has not yet been implemented, as I am still looking for a way to utilise the microphone to process the audio input into pitch. If you have an idea, feel free to let me know. :)
